<p>A plugin for Bukkit that gives easy access to commands by turning your hotbar into a menu.</p>

<p>In a few more words, this is my first bukkit plugin. The code is here in case some kind person wants to come and help me out or maybe clean up my messy code a bit. If you're just starting out, I wouldn't recommend using my code as a guide.</p>

<p>Eventually, I want this plugin to do some fancy things. I have ideas, but they aren't down in code yet. Hopefully that will change sometime in the future as I continue working on it :)</p>

<a name="ideas-what-ideas" class="anchor" href="#ideas-what-ideas"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ideas? What ideas?</h1>

<p>Ideas.</p>

<p>-- A class to create a menu that updates every second or so with the nearest players, and when the user clicks on the player he wants it returns the player. This would be used as a sort of a selection system.</p>

<p>-- MODULAR. I want it to be modular. I'm thinking the best way would be to add some numbers to the lore that mean something in my code. This would let an admin disable, say, everything except flying, and then set it so it can't be edited by a non-admin, and then give it to someone. IT SHALL BE CALLED BROOMSTICK</p>

<p>-- Wow, I really need to set up a config file what am I doing not setting up a config file</p>

<p>-- An OP weapons section that, maybe, gives you the weapon when you click or lets you assign it to right click on the main item. The weapons would be things like an instakill infinite (probably not actually infinite but shh) range sniper-rifle. Maybe with particle effects too? That might require some major maths. Other ideas for weapons: TNT sniper, something to kill all entities within a certain range</p>

<a name="can-i-help" class="anchor" href="#can-i-help"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Can I help?</h1>

<p>Yes, please.</p>

<p>If you don't want to do any coding but still would like to help, you can submit suggestions here on github as issues. Also bug reports are great, even at this stage.</p>

<p>I'm doing this whole thing in Eclipse, and the folder git gets this from is a folder called CheatyStick in my workspace folder. No idea if you needed to know any of that.</p>

<a name="but-i-dont-want-to-help" class="anchor" href="#but-i-dont-want-to-help"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But I don't want to help.</h1>

<p>Then why'd you ask? -_-</p>

<h1>
<a name="but-i-doooooo" class="anchor" href="#but-i-doooooo"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>But I doooooo</h1>

<p>Go home, you're drunk.</p>

<h1>
<a name="is-this-on-bukkitdev-or-anywhere-else" class="anchor" href="#is-this-on-bukkitdev-or-anywhere-else"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Is this on BukkitDev or anywhere else?</h1>

<p>No. I will put it on BukkitDev once it's actually useful, has a full feature-set, and is free of serious known bugs.</p>
